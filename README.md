# card_saver
I dont know if anyone else has ever experienced this but in my house there is a constant need to use credit cards and since the print on the cards have worn down you have like a book and you need to type in the numbers from there well not anymore (hopefully) idk this is mainly for my dad maybe useful for someone else who knows
